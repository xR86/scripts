# Sublime configuration

Automating (manual with files, or scripts ...) sublime installation and configuration across Windows and Linux (same key combinations, same packages ...)
[Sublime setup idea](https://github.com/mrmartineau/SublimeTextSetupWiki/issues/3):
+ install sublime 3
+ install package control (it needs a script that is usually run in sublime console, can run from outside context ?)
+ copy the config files
+ next time sublime opens, package control will check packages and install missing ones
